1. ptxas fatal: unresolved extern function '_Znam'
Reason: gpucc (clang) seems to not support new/delete on the device...
Workaround: substitute pre-allocated buffers for dynamically-allocated buffers

2. Incorrect binary when using the orginal inlined PTX in genericMemRead/Write 
handlers
Reason: unclear
Workaround: use isGlobalPtr/isSharedPtr seems to work

3. After manual merging of the two host .bc files, the final binary fails with 
"cudaIllegalAddress".  However, the program terminates normally when running 
under cuda-gdb.
cuda-memcheck catches four out-of-bounds accesses.

4. Regular expressions containing '+' seems not supported by std::regex_match: 
ECMAScript Syntax is not supported yet; basic POSIX grammar doesn't have '+'.
